**Project Description:**
This project is a recreation of the DAWN newspaper front page using pure HTML only. The layout was created using semantic HTML elements and a table-based column structure without using CSS or JavaScript. The goal was to replicate a traditional newspaper layout using basic HTML structure.

**Features Implemented:**
Semantic HTML tags (header, nav, main, article, section, aside, footer)
Table-based column layout
Three images with proper alt attributes
Heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
Unordered list for updates
HTML comments for structure clarity

**Challenges Faced:**
One challenge was creating a newspaper-style layout without using CSS. This was solved by using HTML tables to structure the columns properly and organizing content carefully with semantic tags.
